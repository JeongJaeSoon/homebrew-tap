  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Finish the install with:
        claude-vimium setup
      It installs the Claude plugin, starts the app and starts it at login.
      Then allow claude-vimium in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.

      The app is built and signed on this Mac, so macOS asks for that permission
      again after each upgrade. Run `claude-vimium uninstall` before
      `brew uninstall claude-vimium` to undo what setup changed.
